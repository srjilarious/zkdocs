# zmd (vendored)

This directory is a vendored, modified copy of [zmd](https://github.com/jetzig-framework/zmd),
a Markdown-to-HTML parser written in pure Zig with no dependencies, originally
built for the [Jetzig](https://github.com/jetzig-framework/jetzig) web framework.

- **Upstream:** https://github.com/jetzig-framework/zmd
- **License:** MIT (per upstream repository)
- **Vendored:** 2026-03-30, from upstream's `main` branch, replacing a
  `build.zig.zon` URL dependency (commit `5a7be1250`). Vendored so zkdocs
  could carry local fixes and extensions upstream doesn't have, without
  waiting on or maintaining a fork as a separate package.

None of the files here are unmodified upstream source — treat this as a fork,
not a pristine copy. If upstream zmd fixes any of the same issues independently,
diff before re-vendoring rather than overwriting.

## Changes made since vendoring

**Initial vendor commit (`5a7be1250`):**
- `Node.zig`: `.code`/`.block` nodes no longer pre-HTML-escape their content
  before handing it to the formatter — formatters are now responsible for
  escaping, consistent with every other node type. (Let zkdocs delete two
  workaround functions in `markdown.zig` that existed only to undo this.)
- `Ast.zig`: added `stripBlock()`, which strips only the leading newline
  after a fence line instead of trimming all leading whitespace — preserves
  intentional leading indentation on the first line of a code block.
- `Formatters.zig`: the image handler now emits `alt=""` instead of
  `title=""`, since `node.title` holds the bracket text (the alt text), not
  a tooltip.

**Native GFM table support (`7a652ae`):**
- `tokens.zig`: added `ElementType.table` and the `Table` element constant.
- `Ast.zig`: tables are detected via custom lookahead in `firstToken`
  (`matchTableEnd`/`isTableSeparatorLine`) rather than the generic
  syntax-matching `elements` table, since a table's extent depends on
  multi-line lookahead, not a fixed close delimiter. `parseTable` renders
  the whole block (header + separator + body rows) directly to HTML,
  mirroring how `parseBlock` already handles fenced code. Cell content is
  parsed through a *nested* `Ast`/`Node.toHtml` pass (`appendCellHtml`), so
  cells get full inline support (code spans, links, bold, italic) instead of
  being treated as opaque text — `escapedCode` patches the one gap that left
  (zmd's default `code` formatter doesn't escape HTML, since it assumes a
  caller-supplied override handles that, as zkdocs's own top-level `codeFmt`
  does; table cells needed the same treatment).
- `Formatters.zig`: added the `table` handler field and `Default.table`.
- `Node.zig`: `.table` nodes are now handled alongside `.code`/`.block` in
  the content-writing switch in `toHtml`.

Because table detection sits inside the same tokenizer logic that already
refuses to scan for new tokens while inside a fenced code block, tables
inherited fence-awareness for free — no separate tracking needed, unlike
zkdocs's admonition extraction (still a pre-processing pass in
`../markdown.zig`, since admonitions have a recursively-rendered body zmd
has no native concept of).
